# Odd Divisors of n  
> *Because even numbers are overrated.*

## About This Project  
This is a beginner-friendly Python script that takes an integer `n` as input and prints all of its **odd divisors**.  
Itâ€™s a tiny project, but a big step for anyone starting out in programming.

## How It Works  
The program loops through numbers from `1` to `n`, checks which numbers divide `n` evenly (`n % i == 0`), and filters out only the odd ones (`i % 2 != 0`).

## How to Use  
1. Open your terminal  
2. Run the script:
```bash
python odd_divisors.py
